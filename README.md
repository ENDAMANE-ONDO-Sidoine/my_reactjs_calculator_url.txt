# Welcome to My Reactjs Calculator
***

## Task
The challenge at hand is to create a functional Reactjs Calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /). 
The task involves building a single-route application that not only displays the result of the operations but also supports multiple operations and provides the ability to clear the buffer.

## Description
To solve this problem, we have leveraged the power of ReactJS, a versatile JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
The application is structured to have no more than one component per file, promoting modular and organized development.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
- Generate a ReactJS project:
    `npx create-react-app mycalculator`
    or
    `npx create-react-app mycalculator`

## Usage
To run the project, use the following commands:
    `npm start`
    or
    `yarn start`
